While 3D printing has become more common in recent years, the 3D-printed clothes industry is still in its infancy. 
At this year's CES tech show, BBC Click's Jen Copestake tried out various 3D-printed items including a dress, glasses and runners. 
The runners were from New Balance and 3D Systems and are the world's first commercially available running shoe with a 3D-printed midsole. 
The shoes are due to go on sale this April but the price has not yet been released.
