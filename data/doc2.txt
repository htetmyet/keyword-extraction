A victim of the Cologne New Year's Eve sex attacks has told BBC News how she and her friends became surrounded by between 20 and 30 men. 
At least 90 criminal complaints have been made to police about the harassment by gangs at the city's main railway station. 
The attacks were said to involve groups of drunk and aggressive young men which witnesses and police said were of Arab or North African appearance.
