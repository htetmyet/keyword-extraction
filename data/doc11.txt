Anglican Church leaders have effectively re-affirmed their opposition to same-sex marriage - by punishing the liberal US Episcopal Church over the issue. 
The Episcopal Church has been suspended from Anglican committees and decision-making for three years after allowing its clergy to perform same sex marriages. 
The decision was taken by a majority of church leaders at a meeting of the Anglican Communion in Canterbury.
