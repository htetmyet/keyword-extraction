Eleven-year-old Anushka Binoy has scored the maximum 162 to get into the high-IQ society Mensa. 
She told BBC Asian Network's Anisa Kadri she was "flabbergasted" when she walked into the exam hall as everyone was much older than her. 
Anushka, from Isleworth, west London, says she loves creative writing and wants to join the society's specialist group.
