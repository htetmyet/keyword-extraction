Chinese artist Ai Weiwei has said he is happy about Lego's decision to no longer ask people who place bulk orders with them what they intend to do with the bricks. 
In October last year, he accused Lego of censorship when it refused to sell its bricks directly to him. 
The company said its policy was to reject requests if it believed the bricks would be used to make a political statement. 
It is not the first time Lego has been embroiled in controversy.
