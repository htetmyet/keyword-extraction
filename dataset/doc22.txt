CB names four new faces for Myanmar¡¯s banking sector
The Central Bank has granted four new licences to foreign lenders following a second round of applications to broaden Myanmar¡¯s banking sector. 
Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam, Taiwanese firm E.SUN Commercial Bank, South Korea¡¯s Shinhan Bank and State Bank of India will each receive a licence, according to an announcement from the Central Bank¡¯s Licensing Committee on March 4. 

The preliminary approval is valid for 12 months, during which the successful applicants will have to fulfill commitments made in their answer to the request for proposals sent out in December, the announcement said. The four banks also have to ensure functional banking operations from day one of their branch opening, and comply with requirements laid down by the Central Bank. 

Daw Htet Htet Wint Aung, a senior official at Shinhan Bank, said her firm had signed an agreement with local lender CB Bank for corporate banking and was planning to provide financing for foreign investors. 

¡°Our bank is going to do as much as our customers want and as much as [we are] permitted,¡± she said. 

E.SUN Commercial Bank was the only successful Taiwanese lender out of eight applicants from that country, beating out several larger rivals. CTBC Bank, Mega International Commercial Bank, Taiwan Business Bank, Taiwan Cooperative Bank and Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank all applied. 

Cathay United Bank, E.SUN Commercial Bank and First Commercial Bank were the three Taiwanese lenders shortlisted in the first international bidding round, held in 2014. 

Banks from India had mooted the possibility of lenders from the same country combining forces to form one entity, which would require only one licence. But the Central Bank said it would not permit joint applications. 

Successful banks will be expected to provide US$75 million in initial capital, a steep requirement that has dissuaded some lenders from applying.
