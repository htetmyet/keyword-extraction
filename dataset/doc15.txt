How to stream the 2016 Oscars tonight
The Oscars are finally here. Will Leonardo DiCaprio finally get his Oscar? Will we see another epic celeb-filled selfie from Ellen? 

If you want to catch all the action but won¡¯t be in front of a TV, here are all the ways you can stream the event tonight, starting at 5:30pm PT / 8:30pm ET. 

The show will stream live on ABC.com and the Watch ABC app to cable subscribers in the eight markets with ABC owned-and-operated stations ? Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, Raleigh-Durham, and Philadelphia. 

If you don¡¯t subscribe to cable or aren¡¯t in one of those markets, you¡¯ll have to wait for the full broadcast posted on ABC.com the next day. Sorry cord-cutters. 

But if you do have cable and are looking for a good second-screen activity to keep you busy while you watch, check out ¡°The Oscars Backstage¡± on Oscar.com. The site will let fans view footage from over 20 live cameras on the red carpet and backstage, letting you feel like you¡¯re basically at the event. 

If you prefer a really immersive Oscars experience, ABC-owned TV station ABC7 in Los Angeles is offering a 360 VR viewing experience to get fans ready for the show. 

Beginning today at 2pm PST, viewers can experience a walk down the red carpet, the Hollywood sign, and a preview of the Oscars 2016 Governors Ball. The experience will be available online here, or via Littlestar VR¡®s web, mobile, and Apple TV app. 

Unfortunately the show itself won¡¯t be available in VR, but hey ? there is always hope for next year.
