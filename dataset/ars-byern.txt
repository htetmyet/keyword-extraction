Arsenal 2-0 Bayern Munich: Five talking points from the Emirates

Arsenal are up and running in Group F of the Champions League after a famous 2-0 victory over Bayern Munich at the Emirates. 
Despite having just 27 per cent of the possession in the game, substitute Olivier Giroud bundled the Gunners in front on 76 minutes. 
Before the opener it was a match dominated by goalkeeping brilliance from Petr Cech and Manuel Neuer. 
With Bayern chasing a late equaliser, Arsenal doubled their lead in stoppage time as Mesut Ozil finished off a counter attack. 
After defeats in Croatia against Dinamo Zagreb and at home to Olympiakos in their opening two games of the competition, Arsenal now are back in the hunt for qualification from the group stage. 
The game took a few minutes to fall into a rhythm, but that wouldn't have bothered a portion of the travelling Bayern Munich fans, who staged a protest over the ¡Ì64 tickets to sit in the away end by refusing to enter stadium for the first five minutes. 
Mesut Ozil sparked the match into life on seven minutes, marauding into space 20 yards from goal but Neuer pushed the ball away. 
Xabi Alonso started to dictate things from his deep-lying position and he instigated a move that saw Thiago denied from 12 yards by Cech after a brilliant one-two with Robert Lewandowski. 
Cech was called into action again on 28 minutes to fly across his goal to palm Arturo Vidal's effort from the edge of the box to safety. 
The game was now flowing from end-to-end and Alexis Sanchez, who had struggled to get into the game, found space to fire a first-time effort from 18 yards just wide.
