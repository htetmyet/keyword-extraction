GoPro stock drops 23% after announcing layoffs and disappointing Q4 guidance
GoPro¡¯s stock dropped 23.34 percent to 10.87 Wednesday afternoon after the company announced its Q4 was worse than expected. The stock was already trading at an all-time low. The stock briefly jumped to 11.20 before trading was halted. The company has a market cap of about $2 billion in after-hour values. 
This came after the company announced it expects fourth quarter revenue will be $435 million and $1.6 billion for 2015. That¡¯s under what the company had previously forecasted. 
GoPro¡¯s stock was already dropping as the company faced mounting pressure from investors to sell more cameras and find new revenue streams. 
As such, the company is laying off 7 percent of its 1,500 people ? about 105 people. As today¡¯s press release states, GoPro had previously experienced an explosion of new staffing, growing at a 50 percent rate over the last two years. GoPro notes that it will incur about $5 million to $10 million as it restructures. 
GoPro went public in mid-2014 with a stock price of $35 and quickly shot up to $89 a share. But since that high, the stock gradually dropped until the summer of 2015 when it lost over half of its value over several weeks. Investors are worried about the company¡¯s ability to keep growing after its latest camera, the Hero 4 Session, failed to outsell previous models. 
GoPro¡¯s CEO and founder Nick Woodman was the fifth-highest paid CEO among U.S. public companies in 2015 with a total compensation package of $77 million, an increase over the previous year of 4,079 percent.
