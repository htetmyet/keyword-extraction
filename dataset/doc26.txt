US election 2016: Trump wins in Mississippi, Michigan and Hawaii
Donald Trump has won three more states, Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii, in his bid to be the Republican White House nomination. 
In the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders had a surprise victory in Michigan, but Hillary Clinton increased her overall lead with a big Mississippi win. 
Ted Cruz won a Republican-only race in Idaho. 
The states are the latest to choose candidates to compete in November's presidential election. 
It was a terrible night for Republican Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who came in a distant fourth in both Michigan and Mississippi, a week before his must-win contest in his home state. 
Mr Trump, a businessman with no experience of elected office, leads the polls in Florida, from where he delivered his victory speech on Tuesday night. 
"One of the things I am most happy about is the turnout has been just massive¡¦ I think it's the single biggest story in politics today," he said at a press conference in Jupiter.
