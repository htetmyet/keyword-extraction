Nissan faces South Korean fine over 'faked' emissions results
Nissan has been accused of manipulating emissions tests for its popular Qashqai model by the South Korean government. 
The allegations follow a probe of 20 diesel car models by the environment ministry. South Korea said it found a so-called defeat devices had been fitted to the Qashqai. 
It plans to fine the Japanese car manufacturer 330 million won (¡Ì195,000; $279,920) and sue the head of Nissan's Korean operations. 
Nissan has denied any wrongdoing. 
Nissan is the second car manufacturer to have been found to use the so-called emissions cheating software after Volkswagen admitted cheating emissions tests in the US across its range of models in September. 
And last month, Japanese car manufacturer Mitsubishi Motors admitted to having falsified fuel efficiency test data for decades. 
Nissan is set to become Mitsubishi's biggest shareholder after agreeing last week to buy a 34% stake in the company. 
The South Korean government has called for the recall of hundreds of Nissan vehicles. 
In a statement Nissan said: "Nissan Motor has never illegally manipulated any vehicles we have produced so far and used defeat devices in those cars."
