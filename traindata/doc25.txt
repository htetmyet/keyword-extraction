Danny Rose to make England debut against Germany
Tottenham defender Danny Rose will make his England debut against Germany at the Olympiastadion in Berlin on Saturday. 

The left-back, who has been capped 29 times by England's U-21s, will make his first senior appearance for the Three Lions after impressing this season for Spurs. 

Rose is joined in the starting line-up by Tottenham team-mates Eric Dier, Dele Alli and Harry Kane. 
Kane, who will be aiming to score his first goal for England since last September, will be supported in the England attack by Adam Lallana and Danny Welbeck. 

There is no place in the team for in-form Leicester midfielder Danny Drinkwater, with Liverpool's Jordan Henderson selected in the midfield alongside Alli and Dier. 
Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland will start in the absence of the injured Joe Hart, with Southampton shot-stopper Fraser Forster now likely to play against the Netherlands at Wembley on Tuesday. 
Gary Cahill, who was named as England's captain for the clash against Germany on Friday, will be partnered in central defence by Chris Smalling, with Nathaniel Clyne to start at right-back. 

England team to face Germany: (4-3-3) Butland, Clyne, Smalling, Cahill, Rose, Henderson, Dier, Alli, Lallana, Kane, Welbeck.
